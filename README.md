My name is Suryavir, I am a 15 year old freelancer that just enjoys the world of programming. I usually lurk around discord (`Cync7X#7777`) all day, or I'm out with my family or doing whatever. 

## Things I'm good at

- Being an idiot (ask my friends)
- Sleeping
- JavaScript & [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - TypeScript is fucking AMAZING!

I also make some random NPM packages, but thats for you to search for on NPM, I'd rather not show my shitty code that I made months ago.
